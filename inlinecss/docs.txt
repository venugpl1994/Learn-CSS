Dis of inline css:
1. it is one to one (write once and use once)
2.because one to one,code redundancy will happen.
3.if code coplicated will happen then file size will increase.
	then to store heavy weight file we need more hard disc space.
4. if file weight is more then page loading will very slow.
5.if page is slow the customer will wait for 5seconds after that close the page and to
to other website.
6.miss use of internal data.
